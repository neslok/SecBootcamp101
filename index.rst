Nutanix takes a holistic approach to security with a secure platform, extensive automation, and a robust partner ecosystem. The Nutanix security development life cycle (SecDL) integrates security into every step of product development, rather than applying it as an afterthought. The SecDL is a foundational part of product design. The strong pervasive culture and processes built around security harden the Enterprise Cloud Platform and eliminate zero-day vulnerabilities. Efficient one-click operations and self-healing security models easily enable automation to maintain security in an always-on hyperconverged solution.

This workshop introduces some of the basic security activities such as checking for and changing default passwords, hardening the the platform and advanced VM security with Flow microsegmentation.
